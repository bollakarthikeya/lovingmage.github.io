3. Solid foundation in algorithms and data structures.
4. Proficiency in system or lower-level (verilog, HLS, etc.) programming.
5. Solid knowledge in system design or computer architecture.


#### Desirable, but not essential:

1. Backgrounds in crypto, differential privacy, MPC, or trusted hardware.

3. **Architecture:** Experience in FPGA prototype implementation.
4. Industry experience is highly valued.
