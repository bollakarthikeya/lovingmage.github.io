<b></b>

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Indiana University. I am also affiliated with Luddyâ€™s Security & Privacy in Informatics, Computing, and Engineering ([SPICE](https://spice.luddy.indiana.edu/)) Center. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Duke University under the supervision of [Ashwin Machanavajjhala](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/) and [Kartik Nayak](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/).


I have a keen interest in the synergy of cryptography and differential privacy, particularly when harnessed to architect large-scale systems for the management, computation, and learning over confidential data. My current research focuses are listed as follows:

- [Encrypted databases](/projects/#dbms)
- [Secure and Trustworthy AI/ML systems](/projects/#ai)
- [Private distributed systems/ blockchains](/projects/#blockchain)


<span style="color:blue"> **I am looking for self-motivated students starting Fall 2023, with multiple fully-funded RA positions available. If any of the research topics capture your interest, feel free to drop me an email along with your CV. More details can be found [here](https://www.lovingmage.com/blog/2023/phd-ra/)** </span>
