<b></b>

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Indiana University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Duke University under the supervision of [Ashwin Machanavajjhala](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/) and [Kartik Nayak](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/).


I am generally interested in applied cryptography, differential privacy, distributed systems(blockchains), and databases. My current research focuses are listed as follows:

- [Privacy-aware data systems](/projects/#dbms)
- [Private distributed ledgers/ blockchains](/projects/#blockchain)
- [Trustworthy AI/ML systems](/projects/#ai)

<span style="color:blue"> **I am looking for self-motivated students starting Fall 2023, with multiple fully-funded RA positions available. If any of the research topics capture your interest, feel free to drop me an email along with your CV. More details can be found [here](https://www.lovingmage.com/blog/2023/phd-ra/)** </span>
