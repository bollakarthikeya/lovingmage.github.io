<b></b>

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Indiana University. I am also affiliated with Luddyâ€™s Security & Privacy in Informatics, Computing, and Engineering ([SPICE](https://spice.luddy.indiana.edu/)) Center. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Duke University under the supervision of [Ashwin Machanavajjhala](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/) and [Kartik Nayak](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/).


My research focuses on developing full-stack solutions for privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics (PPDSA), which spans theory, systems, and architecture advancements. Specifically, my current current research can be summarized as follows:

- **Theory**
  - PAC based privacy methods ([Usenix 23](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/wang-chenghong))
  - Synergy of cryptography and differential privacy ([SIGMOD 20](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07756), [21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15942), [22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05084))
- **Systems**
  - Private data federation and encrypted databases ([IncShrink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05084), [Special](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18388), [FL-NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.606/))
  - Learning-augumented PPDSA systems
- **Architecture**
  - Leakage-resistant TEEs (Micro-architecture and ISA)
  - Hardware acceleration and synthesis for PPDSA ([MICRO 23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613424.3614297), [NeurIPS 23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14331), [DAC 23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15513), [ICCV 23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10134))
