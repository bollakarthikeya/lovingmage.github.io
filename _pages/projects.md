## Privacy-aware data systems <a name="dbms"></a>
A persistent issue in today's society is that organizations handling private or sensitive data, i.e. health records, banking transactions, defense industry and military data etc, strive to engage in collaborative data analysis, but they are restricted from sharing it. 

Our aspiration is to architect pragmatic data systems to facilitate the practice of collaborative analytics over confidential data. To accomplish this aim, we delve into the synergistic relationship among **differential privacy**, **cryptography**, and **trusted hardwares** by establishing innovative algorithms and system designs that articulate the interconnection between these spheres, taking into account both theoretical perspectives and pragmatic approaches to systems building.

## Private distributed ledgers/ blockchains <a name="blockchain"></a>

The *permissionless* property has been recognized as one of the key innovations of morden blockchain techniques. However, this inherent open setup has inevitably led to numerous privacy concerns, i.e. everyone can obseve each other's transactions, subsequently attracting enough criticism. A new type of **private** blockchains are proposed that hides transaction details with **cryptographic primitives** while leveraging **zero-knowledge proofs** for validating transactions and upholding blockchain functionalities. 

My interests in this area primarily include: (i)Fundamentally understand the privacy implications of existing private blockchains; (ii) Explore principled techniques for designing efficient and robust private blockchains.
